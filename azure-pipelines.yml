# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:

    # The next command starts the server and runs Cypress end-to-end tests against it.
    # The test artifacts (video, screenshots, test output) will be uploaded to Cypress dashboard
    # To record on Cypress dashboard we need to set CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY environment variable
    # environment variable BUILD_BUILDNUMBER is a good candidate
